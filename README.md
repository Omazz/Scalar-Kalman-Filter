# Scalar-Kalman-Filter
## Introduction
This github repository is based on balzer82 repository.  
I wanted to make my own implementation of various Kalman filters on C language.   
In th–µ future, this repo will present of all the Kalman filters that he analyzed.  

## CV model:

### One-dimensional case:  
[See the lib](...)  
[View IPython Notebook](https://github.com/Omazz/Scalar-Kalman-Filter/blob/main/docs/1dim_CV.ipynb)

### Two-dimensional case:
[See the lib](...)  
[View IPython Notebook](https://github.com/Omazz/Scalar-Kalman-Filter/blob/main/docs/2dim_CV.ipynb)

## CA model:

### One-dimensional case:
